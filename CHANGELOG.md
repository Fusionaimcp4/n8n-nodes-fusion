### Fixed
- **LangChain Tool Conversion**: Fixed tool serialization for proper API forwarding
  - LangChain tools are now converted to OpenAI format before sending
  - Supports `toJSON()` method and `schema` property extraction
  - Prevents sending placeholder objects to backend

  - Accepts OpenAI-native tool format (from n8n)
  - Supports legacy Anthropic-style format (`input_schema`)
  - Handles minimal format with `parameters` only

## [0.2.5] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- **Provider Mapping**: Fixed Anthropic Claude models routing to wrong API
  - Maps "anthropic" provider to "claude" to match backend expectations
  - Prevents "404 model not found" errors when using Claude models
  - Applied to all three nodes (FusionChatModel, FusionChat, Fusion)
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added detailed logging for tool-calling diagnostics
  - Logs provider mapping transformations
  - Shows bound tools and full request payload
  - Helps diagnose tool-calling issues

## [0.2.4] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- **Tool-Calling Passthrough**: Enabled tool-calling functionality in FusionChatModel
  - Tools are now properly forwarded to Fusion API when `bindTools()` is called
  - Tool calls and invalid tool calls are now parsed from API responses
  - Maintains backward compatibility when no tools are bound
- Updated TypeScript interface to support tool response fields

## [0.2.3] - 2024-10-XX

### Added
- Security policy and vulnerability reporting guidelines
